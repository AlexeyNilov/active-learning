# Active language learning strategy

## Phase 1 'Build vocabulary'
* Choose a movie, get subtitles
* Get the most common verbs from the subtitles
* Create flashcards (duocards) for unknown verbs
* Ask duo (or any other suitable AI) to explain new words and give some examples
* Train (do spaced repetition) with the cards

## Phase 2 'Active watching'
* [optional] Get related phrases/sentences from the subtitles and practice them
* Watch the movie
* Shadow (repeat/act by yourself) interesting scenes/sentences
